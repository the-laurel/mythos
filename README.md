WasmX: An Universe of Compute. Any Language, Any Sourcecode, Any Bytecode

Applied to a governable, modular (WebAssembly), upgradable/living system, in the form of a blockchain built by and for volunteers: Mythos.

WasmX is the blockchain core Go module with support for multiple executions engines. You can execute smart contracts written in JavaScript, Python, Go, Solidity (EVM), Rust (CosmWasm) on the same chain, in the same Universe (state, storage).

This is a volunteer-based project. You can help validate & test the chain by joining our Discord: https://discord.gg/8W5jeBke4f. Testnet information [here](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/tempreleases/tree/main/mythos-testnet).
